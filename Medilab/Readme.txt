Project: Smart Hospital Queue and Bed Management System

As part of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024, I developed a Smart Hospital Queue and Bed Management System addressing problem statement 1620. The project focuses on optimizing the flow of patients in hospital OPDs and improving real-time bed availability management. Our solution integrates a Smart Queuing System for Outpatient Departments (OPDs) with a Real-time Bed Management System, enabling patients to book appointments online, reducing wait times, and streamlining patient allocation. By utilizing modern web technologies and data-driven decision-making, we aim to significantly improve the patient experience and operational workflows in healthcare settings.
